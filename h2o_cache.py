# The KV cache is just past K and V vectors saved between generation steps.
# Why save K and V?
#   - Every new token's Q has to compare itself against every past token's K
#     to decide where to look.
#   - It then mixes past V vectors using those comparison scores.
#   - Without the cache we'd recompute K and V for every past token, every step.
# Why NOT save Q?
#   - Q is only used once: by the token that just got generated.
#   - The next token will compute its own fresh Q. Past Q's are useless.
#
# H2O changes the cache from "keep everything" to "keep what matters":
#   - matters = tokens that received lots of attention across past steps
#   - plus a small window of recent tokens (so the model doesn't lose local context)
